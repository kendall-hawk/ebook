        "**Neil:**<span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"1\">Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.</span>",
        "**Beth:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"2\">And I'm Beth.</span>",
        "**Neil:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"3\">Do you enjoy eating noodles, Beth?</span>",
        "**Beth:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"4\">I love noodles, yes.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"5\">I think my favourite are udon – the big thick ones.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"6\">Mmm, they're so good!</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"7\">Well, some people buy them dried in a packet,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"8\">others make them [[fresh|fresh-adjective]] from wheat or rice,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"9\">but there is little doubt that noodles are [[popular|popular-adjective]] around the world.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"10\">From their [[origins|origins-noun]], probably somewhere in China,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"11\">noodle [[recipes|recipes-noun]] were [[spread|spread-verb]] by [[traders|traders-noun]] on the ancient Silk Road.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"12\">At each [[destination|destination-noun]] along the road, people gave noodles a twist,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"13\">adding different [[flavours|flavour-noun]] and [[ingredients|ingredients-noun]] to create a new dish.</span>",
        "**Neil:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"14\">In this programme, we'll visit the United States and Japan,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"15\">two countries which have taken noodles and created exciting new [[varieties|varieties-noun]].</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"16\">As usual, we'll learn some useful new vocabulary,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"17\">and remember – you can read along with the transcript of this programme,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"18\">available now on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</span>",
        "**Beth:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"19\">But first, Neil, I have a question for you.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"20\">As well as different shapes and ingredients,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"21\">noodles come in many different [[flavours|flavour-noun]].</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"22\">So which region of China is famous for its spicy [[flavours|flavour-noun]]?</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"23\">Is it: a) Shanghai, b) Sichuan, or c) Guangzhou?</span>",
        "**Neil:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"24\">Well, I think actually, Beth, I know the answer to this.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"25\">I've been lucky enough to have been to this place.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"26\">I think it's b) Sichuan.</span>",
        "**Beth:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"27\">OK. Well, you sound confident.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"28\">I will reveal the answer later in the programme.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"29\">BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"30\">investigated how noodles [[spread|spread-verb]] from Asia through Europe to America.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"31\">They uncovered a surprising story: that pasta comes</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"32\">from noodles brought back to Italy by Marco Polo in the 13th century.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"33\">Jen Lin-Liu, author of the book,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"34\">'On the Noodle Road', doesn't believe this story.</span>",
        "**Jen Lin-Liu:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"35\">So, noodles were very [[exotic|exotic-adjective]] in the 1920s and 30s in the United States,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"36\">and there was a new pasta [[association|association-noun]] in America</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"37\">that wanted to [[promote|promote-verb]] the [[manufacturing|manufacturing-noun]] of dried pasta.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"38\">And so they came up with a story</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"39\">about how Marco Polo went to China</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"40\">and found the noodle there,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"41\">and brought it all the way to Italy.</span>",
        "**Neil:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"42\">In the 1920s, noodles were [[popular|popular-adjective]] because they were [[exotic|exotic-adjective]],</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"43\">[[meaning|meaning-verb]] [[foreign|foreign-adjective]], unusual and exciting.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"44\">At that time pasta companies were [[promoting|promote-verb]] a new [[invention|invention-noun]], dried pasta,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"45\">so they came up with a story about Marco Polo to sell more pasta.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"46\">If you come up with something, you suggest or think up an idea.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"47\">And it worked – sales of pasta jumped as a result!</span>",
        "**Beth:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"48\">Now, our second [[destination|destination-noun]], Japan, also has a history of eating noodles.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"49\">One of the most famous Japanese noodle dishes is ramen,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"50\">and Frank Striegl, a blogger living in Tokyo, knows all about it.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"51\">He eats over 300 bowls of ramen a year!</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"52\">He explained to BBC World Service's The Food Chain how Chinese immigrants</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"53\">to Japan in the late 1800s influenced this Japanese dish.</span>",
        "**Frank Striegl:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"54\">And at one point or another, different chefs decided to [[localise|localise-verb]] these dishes.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"55\">They said, \"We love these Chinese noodle dishes.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"56\">However, why don't we tweak them?</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"57\">Why don't we make them a little bit more Japanese?\"</span>",
        "**Neil:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"58\">Frank says that at one point or another, chefs started to make</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"59\">noodle dishes more Japanese.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"60\">Here, the phrase, at one point or another,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"61\">means at some [[unspecified|unspecified-adjective]] time in the past.</span>",
        "**Beth:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"62\">They did this by tweaking Chinese noodles – in other words,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"63\">by changing them slightly to make them better, different,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"64\">or in this case, more Japanese.</span>",
        "**Neil:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"65\">By making these tweaks, adding new toppings and [[slices|slices-noun]] of beef or chicken,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"66\">Japanese chefs created the noodle dish we know today as ramen.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"67\">Here's Frank Striegl again, talking with BBC World Service's The Food Chain.</span>",
        "**Frank Striegl:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"68\">And what I find fascinating about ramen,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"69\">compared to perhaps other wonderful noodle dishes around the world,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"70\">is that ramen continues to evolve.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"71\">Unlike other Japanese foods, it's OK to push the [[boundaries|boundaries-noun]].</span>",
        "**Beth:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"72\">Frank thinks that Japanese ramen continues to evolve –</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"73\">to develop and change [[gradually|gradually-adverb]]</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"74\">in [[response|response-noun]] to new developments and ideas.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"75\">Unlike other [[traditional|traditional-adjective]] foods such as sushi,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"76\">modern versions of ramen push the [[boundaries|boundaries-noun]].</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"77\">If you push the [[boundaries|boundaries-noun]],</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"78\">you act in a way which challenges normal, [[acceptable|acceptable-adjective]] behaviour.</span>",
        "**Neil:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"79\">Yes, noodles have changed so much since ancient times</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"80\">that today you can buy them dried in a packet and simply add hot water.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"81\">But the [[flavours|flavour-noun]] and the noodles themselves maintain a link to the past.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"82\">Now, speaking of [[flavours|flavour-noun]], what was the answer to your question, Beth?</span>",
        "**Beth:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"83\">Well, I asked you which region of China is famous for its spicy [[flavours|flavour-noun]].</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"84\">You were very confident with saying Sichuan and that is the correct answer.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"85\">Sichuan is a place that is famous for spicy food,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"86\">such as the Sichuan pepper and Sichuan hotpot.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"87\">OK. It's time to recap the vocabulary we've learnt.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"88\">If you give something a twist,</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"89\">you change it in some small way to create something new and exciting.</span>",
        "**Neil:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"90\">The adjective [[exotic|exotic-adjective]] means unusual and exciting</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"91\">because of coming from far away.</span>",
        "**Beth:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"92\">The phrase at one point or another means at some [[unspecified|unspecified-adjective]] time in the past.</span>",
        "**Neil:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"93\">If you tweak something, you alter it slightly in order to improve it.</span>",
        "**Beth:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"94\">Something which evolves, develops and changes gradually.</span>",
        "**Neil:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"95\">And finally, the [[idiom|idiom-noun]] to push the [[boundaries|boundaries-noun]]</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"96\">means to do things which challenge normal, [[acceptable|acceptable-adjective]] behaviour.</span>",
        "**Neil:** <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"97\">Once again, our six minutes are up.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"98\">If you enjoyed the programme, why not visit our website and check out all</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"99\">of the different podcasts that we have at BBC Learning English.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"100\">There's something there for everyone.</span> <span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"101\">Thanks for joining us and goodbye.</span><span class=\"subtitle-segment\" data-subtitle-id=\"102\">Bye!</span>"
