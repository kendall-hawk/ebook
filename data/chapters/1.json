Well, some people buy them dried in a packet, others make them [[fresh|fresh-adjective]] from wheat or rice, but there is little doubt that noodles are [[popular|popular-adjective]] around the world. From their [[origins|origins-noun]], probably somewhere in China, noodle [[recipes|recipes-noun]] were [[spread|spread-verb]] by [[traders|traders-noun]] on the ancient Silk Road. At each [[destination|destination-noun]] along the road, people gave noodles a twist, adding different [[flavours|flavour-noun]] and [[ingredients|ingredients-noun]] to create a new dish."

So which region of China is famous for its spicy [[flavours|flavour-noun]]? Is it:\na)    Shanghai,\nb)    Sichuan, or\nc)    Guangzhou?"

      "type": "transcript",
      "content": "**Beth:** OK. Well, you sound confident. I will reveal the answer later in the programme. BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, [[investigated|investigated-verb]] how noodles [[spread|spread-verb]] from Asia through Europe to America. They [[uncovered|uncovered-verb]] a surprising story: that pasta comes from noodles brought back to Italy by Marco Polo in the 13th century. Jen Lin-Liu, author of the book 'On the Noodle Road', doesn't believe this story."

      "content": "**Jen Lin-Liu:** So, noodles were very [[exotic|exotic-adjective]] in the 1920s and 30s in the United States, and there was a new pasta [[association|association-noun]] in America that wanted to [[promote|promote-verb]] the [[manufacturing|manufacturing-noun]] of dried pasta. And so they came up with a story about how Marco Polo went to China and found the noodle there, and brought it all the way to Italy."

       "type": "transcript",
      "content": "**Neil:** In the 1920s, noodles were [[popular|popular-adjective]] because they were [[exotic|exotic-adjective]], [[meaning|meaning-verb]] [[foreign|foreign-adjective]], unusual and exciting. At that time pasta companies were [[promoting|promote-verb]] a new [[invention|invention-noun]], dried pasta, so they came up with a story about Marco Polo to sell more pasta. If you come up with something, you suggest or think up an idea. And it worked – sales of pasta jumped as a result!"

      "content": "**Beth:** Now, our second [[destination|destination-noun]], Japan, also has a history of eating noodles. One of the most famous Japanese noodle dishes is ramen, and Frank Striegl, a blogger living in Tokyo, knows all about it. He eats over 300 bowls of ramen a year! He explained to BBC World Service's The Food Chain how Chinese immigrants to Japan in the late 1800s influenced this Japanese dish."

      "type": "transcript",

Unlike other [[traditional|traditional-adjective]] food such as sushi, modern versions of ramen push the [[boundaries|boundaries-noun]]. If you push the [[boundaries|boundaries-noun]], you act in a way which challenges normal [[acceptable|acceptable-adjective]] behaviour."

       "type": "transcript",
      "content": "**Neil:** Yes, noodles have changed so much since ancient times that today you can buy them dried in a packet and simply add hot water. But the [[flavours|flavour-noun]] and the noodles themselves maintain a link to the past. Now, speaking of [[flavours|flavour-noun]], what was the answer to your question, Beth?"

    {
      "type": "transcript",
      "content": "**Beth:** Well, I asked you which region of China is famous for its spicy [[flavours|flavour-noun]]. You were very confident with saying Sichuan and that is the correct answer. Sichuan is a place that is famous for spicy food, such as the Sichuan pepper and Sichuan hotpot. OK. It's time to recap the vocabulary we've learnt. If you give something a twist, you change it in some small way to create something new and exciting."
