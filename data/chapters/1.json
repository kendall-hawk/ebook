The story that Marco Polo brought pasta back to Italy from China in the 13th century is a myth. It was created by a pasta association in America in the 1920s and 30s to promote dried pasta [00:02:12]."

    "## TRANSCRIPT",
    "**Neil:** Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.",
    "**Beth:** And I'm Beth.",
    "**Neil:** Do you enjoy eating noodles, Beth?",
    "**Beth:** I love noodles, yes. I think my favourite are udon ‚Äì the big thick ones. Mmm, they're so good! Well, some people buy them dried in a packet, others make them <span data-tooltip-id=\"fresh-adjective\" class=\"word\">fresh</span> from wheat or rice, but there is little doubt that noodles are <span data-tooltip-id=\"popular-adjective\" class=\"word\">popular</span> around the world. From their <span data-tooltip-id=\"origins-noun\" class=\"word\">origins</span>, probably somewhere in China, noodle <span data-tooltip-id=\"recipes-noun\" class=\"word\">recipes</span> were <span data-tooltip-id=\"spread-verb\" class=\"word\">spread</span> by <span data-tooltip-id=\"traders-noun\" class=\"word\">traders</span> on the ancient Silk Road. At each <span data-tooltip-id=\"destination-noun\" class=\"word\">destination</span> along the road, people gave noodles a twist, adding different <span data-tooltip-id=\"flavour-noun\" class=\"word\">flavours</span> and <span data-tooltip-id=\"ingredients-noun\" class=\"word\">ingredients</span> to create a new dish.",
    "**Neil:** In this programme, we'll visit the United States and Japan, two countries which have taken noodles and created exciting new <span data-tooltip-id=\"varieties-noun\" class=\"word\">varieties</span>. As usual, we'll learn some useful new vocabulary, and remember ‚Äì you can read along with the transcript of this programme, available now on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.",
    "**Beth:** But first, Neil, I have a question for you. As well as different shapes and <span data-tooltip-id=\"ingredients-noun\" class=\"word\">ingredients</span>, noodles come in many different <span data-tooltip-id=\"flavour-noun\" class=\"word\">flavours</span>. So which region of China is famous for its spicy <span data-tooltip-id=\"flavour-noun\" class=\"word\">flavours</span>? Is it:\na)    Shanghai,\nb)    Sichuan, or\nc)    Guangzhou?",
    "**Neil:** Well, I think actually, Beth, I know the answer to this. I've been lucky enough to have been to this place. I think it's b) Sichuan.",
    "**Beth:** OK. Well, you sound confident. I will reveal the answer later in the programme. BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, <span data-tooltip-id=\"investigated-verb\" class=\"word\">investigated</span> how noodles <span data-tooltip-id=\"spread-verb\" class=\"word\">spread</span> from Asia through Europe to America. They <span data-tooltip-id=\"uncovered-verb\" class=\"word\">uncovered</span> a surprising story: that pasta comes from noodles brought back to Italy by Marco Polo in the 13th century. Jen Lin-Liu, author of the book 'On the Noodle Road', doesn't believe this story.",
    "**Jen Lin-Liu:** So, noodles were very <span data-tooltip-id=\"exotic-adjective\" class=\"word\">exotic</span> in the 1920s and 30s in the United States, and there was a new pasta <span data-tooltip-id=\"association-noun\" class=\"word\">association</span> in America that wanted to <span data-tooltip-id=\"promote-verb\" class=\"word\">promote</span> the <span data-tooltip-id=\"manufacturing-noun\" class=\"word\">manufacturing</span> of dried pasta. And so they came up with a story about how Marco Polo went to China and found the noodle there, and brought it all the way to Italy.",
    "**Neil:** In the 1920s, noodles were <span data-tooltip-id=\"popular-adjective\" class=\"word\">popular</span> because they were <span data-tooltip-id=\"exotic-adjective\" class=\"word\">exotic</span>, <span data-tooltip-id=\"meaning-verb\" class=\"word\">meaning</span> <span data-tooltip-id=\"foreign-adjective\" class=\"word\">foreign</span>, unusual and exciting. At that time pasta companies were <span data-tooltip-id=\"promoting-verb\" class=\"word\">promoting</span> a new <span data-tooltip-id=\"invention-noun\" class=\"word\">invention</span>, dried pasta, so they came up with a story about Marco Polo to sell more pasta. If you come up with something, you suggest or think up an idea. And it worked ‚Äì sales of pasta jumped as a result!",
    "**Beth:** Now, our second <span data-tooltip-id=\"destination-noun\" class=\"word\">destination</span>, Japan, also has a history of eating noodles. One of the most famous Japanese noodle dishes is ramen, and Frank Striegl, a blogger living in Tokyo, knows all about it. He eats over 300 bowls of ramen a year! He explained to BBC World Service's The Food Chain how Chinese immigrants to Japan in the late 1800s influenced this Japanese dish.",
    "**Frank Striegl:** And at one point or another, different chefs decided to <span data-tooltip-id=\"localise-verb\" class=\"word\">localise</span> these dishes. They said, \"We love these Chinese noodle dishes. However, why don't we tweak them? Why don't we make them a little bit more Japanese?\"",
    "**Neil:** Frank says that at one point or another, chefs started to make noodle dishes more Japanese. Here, the phrase at one point or another means at some <span data-tooltip-id=\"unspecified-adjective\" class=\"word\">unspecified</span> time in the past.",
    "**Beth:** They did this by tweaking Chinese noodles ‚Äì in other words, by changing them slightly to make them better, different or, in this case, more Japanese.",
    "**Neil:** By making these tweaks, adding new toppings and <span data-tooltip-id=\"slices-noun\" class=\"word\">slices</span> of beef or chicken, Japanese chefs created the noodle dish we know today as ramen. Here's Frank Striegl again, talking with BBC World Service's The Food Chain.",
    "**Frank Striegl:** And what I find fascinating about ramen, compared to perhaps other wonderful noodle dishes around the world, is that ramen continues to evolve. Unlike other Japanese foods, it's OK to push the <span data-tooltip-id=\"boundaries-noun\" class=\"word\">boundaries</span>.",
    "**Beth:** Frank thinks that Japanese ramen continues to evolve ‚Äì to develop and change <span data-tooltip-id=\"gradually-adverb\" class=\"word\">gradually</span> in <span data-tooltip-id=\"response-noun\" class=\"word\">response</span> to new developments and ideas. Unlike other <span data-tooltip-id=\"traditional-adjective\" class=\"word\">traditional</span> food such as sushi, modern versions of ramen push the <span data-tooltip-id=\"boundaries-noun\" class=\"word\">boundaries</span>. If you push the <span data-tooltip-id=\"boundaries-noun\" class=\"word\">boundaries</span>, you act in a way which challenges normal <span data-tooltip-id=\"acceptable-adjective\" class=\"word\">acceptable</span> behaviour.",
    "**Neil:** Yes, noodles have changed so much since ancient times that today you can buy them dried in a packet and simply add hot water. But the <span data-tooltip-id=\"flavour-noun\" class=\"word\">flavours</span> and the noodles themselves maintain a link to the past. Now, speaking of <span data-tooltip-id=\"flavour-noun\" class=\"word\">flavours</span>, what was the answer to your question, Beth?",
    "**Beth:** Well, I asked you which region of China is famous for its spicy <span data-tooltip-id=\"flavour-noun\" class=\"word\">flavours</span>. You were very confident with saying Sichuan and that is the correct answer. Sichuan is a place that is famous for spicy food, such as the Sichuan pepper and Sichuan hotpot. OK. It's time to recap the vocabulary we've learnt. If you give something a twist, you change it in some small way to create something new and exciting.",
    "**Neil:** The adjective <span data-tooltip-id=\"exotic-adjective\" class=\"word\">exotic</span> means unusual and exciting because of coming from far away.",
    "**Beth:** The phrase, at one point or another means at some <span data-tooltip-id=\"unspecified-adjective\" class=\"word\">unspecified</span> time in the past.",
    "**Neil:** If you tweak something, you alter it slightly in order to improve it.",
    "**Beth:** Something which evolves, develops and changes <span data-tooltip-id=\"gradually-adverb\" class=\"word\">gradually</span>.",
    "**Neil:** And finally, the <span data-tooltip-id=\"idiom-noun\" class=\"word\">idiom</span> to push the <span data-tooltip-id=\"boundaries-noun\" class=\"word\">boundaries</span> means to do things which challenge normal <span data-tooltip-id=\"acceptable-adjective\" class=\"word\">acceptable</span> behaviour.

    "**Beth:** Bye!"
