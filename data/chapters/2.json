    "## TRANSCRIPT",
    "Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.",
    "**Neil:** Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.",
    "**Beth:** And I'm Beth. In this programme, we're talking about [[politeness|politeness-noun]]. Britain has a [[reputation|reputation-noun]] for being a [[polite|politeness-adjective]] place where children are told to say 'please' and 'thank you', but in real life that isn't always true. You, give me that pen!",
    "**Neil:** I'm sorry. That was a bit [[rude|rude-adjective]].",
    "**Beth:** Well, what should I have said?",
    "**Neil:** How about: \"Neil, please could you pass me the pen?\"",
    "**Beth:** Fine. Neil, could you please pass me the pen?",
    "**Neil:** There you go! That's much better.",
    "**Beth:** Now listen as BBC Radio 4 presenter Michael Rosen, who is a [[well-known|well-known-adjective]] poet and children's author in Britain, describes what happened to him one day:",
    "**Michael Rosen:** [[Recently|recently-adverb]], this is how it went: a boy was walking past me in the street, stopped and said, \"Hey! You're [[thingy|thingy-noun]], [[innit|innit-interjection]]!\" Now, that one seems to break all the rules. And because it broke the rules, it gave me a problem. How do I answer it?",
    "**Beth:** A boy saw Michael Rosen and said, \"Hey! You're [[thingy|thingy-noun]], [[innit|innit-interjection]]!\" He used the word [[thingy|thingy-noun]] because, although he [[recognised|recognised-verb]] Michael, he couldn't remember his name. He also said [[innit|innit-interjection]], which is short for 'isn't it', to [[emphasise|emphasis-verb]] what he'd said.",
    "**Neil:** So, was the boy being [[impolite|impolite-adjective]] or was he just happy meeting a famous person in the street? And why do we teach kids to be [[polite|politeness-adjective]] in the first place? That's what we'll be discussing in this programme, using some useful new vocabulary.",
    "**Beth:** But first, I have a question for you, Neil. The British are [[well-known|well-known-adjective]] for being [[polite|politeness-adjective]], as we've said, and there's even an idiom we use in certain situations to remind someone to be especially [[polite|politeness-adjective]]. But what is it?",
    "Is it:",
    "a)    mind your As and Bs,",
    "b)    mind your Ps and Qs, or",
    "c)    mind your Xs and Ys?",
    "**Neil:** Well, I know the answer to this, but I'm going to say c) mind your Xs and Ys, because I think it's [[brilliant|brilliant-adjective]].",
    "**Beth:** OK. Interesting! Well, we'll find out the correct answer later in the programme. So, let's return to the boy who said, \"Hey! You're [[thingy|thingy-noun]], [[innit|innit-interjection]]!\" to famous [[poet|poet-noun]], Michael Rosen. Was that [[impolite|impolite-adjective]] or not? Professor Louise Mullany, who studies the language of [[politeness|politeness-noun]], has an answer. She thinks that [[politeness|politeness-noun]] is as much to do with the person being spoken to as the person speaking, as she explained to BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth:",
    "**Louise Mullany:** I think the crucial thing there is in how you've [[perceived|perceived-verb]] it. So, obviously he's not giving us the [[conventional|conventional-adjective]]: \"Oh, good afternoon, Mr Rosen,\" or a more formal approach. It's [[very|very-adverb]], [[very|very-adverb]] informal… and he can't remember your name, and he's saying '[[innit|innit-interjection]]'. Now, that has been [[interpreted|interpreted-verb]] by you as [[non-threatening|non-threatening-adjective]] to you. You don't see him as [[insulting|insulting-adjective]] you, and you're actually quite kindly disposed to that person. So, you haven't [[interpreted|interpreted-verb]] it as [[offensive|offensive-adjective]] or [[aggressive|aggressive-adjective]]. You said – I think you described it as being quite civil, actually.",
    "**Neil:** Michael Rosen didn't feel that the boy was [[insulting|insulting-adjective]] him. To [[insult|insulting-verb]] someone means to be [[rude|rude-adjective]] or [[offensive|offensive-adjective]] to them.",
    "**Beth:** Although his speech was [[very|very-adverb]] informal, Michael thought the boy was actually pleased to see him, not [[rude|rude-adjective]] at all. Micheal was well disposed to the boy – he liked and approved of him.",
    "**Neil:** So, you could say that [[politeness|politeness-noun]] is subjective; if Michael doesn't feel offended, then where is the offence? Then why do we teach children to be [[polite|politeness-adjective]] at all? Well, according to Professor Mullany, it's to do with the rules of society.",
    "**Beth:** That's right. Louise thinks that by teaching our kids [[politeness|politeness-noun]] they enjoy the [[benefits|benefits-noun]] of being accepted in society. So, imagine how embarrassed she felt when her two-year-old daughter [[repeatedly|repeatedly-adverb]] ignored the cook at her [[nursery|nursery-noun]] school and [[refused|refused-verb]] to say hello. Here's Louise Mullany telling the story to BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth:",
    "**Louise Mullany:** The cook looked so [[disappointed|disappointed-adjective]]. And as I [[mention|mention-verb]] in the book, it felt to me like there were lots of other children skipping – skipping and jumping past going, \"Hello!\" being [[really|really-adverb]] friendly children, and my daughter was just there. And we started to make excuses for her, like, \"Oh, she's tired. Oh, she's teething. She's this and she's that,\" because the embarrassment was so strong. And I felt awful walking back past the [[kitchen|kitchen-noun]] on my way out. I was almost trying to hide my face, going, \"I'm the one with the [[really|really-adverb]] [[rude|rude-adjective]] child.\"",
    "**Neil:** When her daughter didn't say hello to an adult, Louise made excuses for her. If you make excuses for someone, you try to explain the reasons for their behaviour. For example, Louise said her daughter was tired, she was growing new teeth, she was this and that. The idiom this and that can be used to describe [[various|various-adjective]] [[unspecified|unspecified-adjective]] things. For example, if someone asks what you did this afternoon, you might reply, \"Oh, not much. I stayed at home, I watched TV, I did this and that.\"",
    "**Beth:** [[Politeness|politeness-noun]] means different things to different people, but we still like it when people are [[polite|politeness-adjective]] to us, and I think the [[polite|politeness-adjective]] thing to do now is reveal the answer to my question, Neil. So, the idiom that we use to remind someone to be [[polite|politeness-adjective]] is… not 'mind your Xs and Ys' – I'm sorry, Neil. It's 'mind your Ps and Qs'.",
    "**Neil:** That's a shame. Xs and Ys is much better.",
    "**Beth:** OK. Now, let's [[recap|recap-verb]] the vocabulary we've [[learnt|learnt-verb]], starting with [[thingy|thingy-noun]], an informal word that's used if you can't remember someone's or something's name. People also use the slang words, what's-his-name or what's-her-name, for the same reason.",
    "**Neil:** [[Innit|innit-interjection]] is a short form of the tag question, 'isn't it'. It's used to add [[emphasis|emphasis-noun]] to a [[statement|statement-noun]].",
    "**Beth:** The adjective [[insulting|insulting-adjective]] means [[rude|rude-adjective]] or [[offensive|offensive-adjective]]",
    "**Neil:** If you are well disposed to someone, you like and approve of them.",
    "**Beth:** When you make excuses for someone, you explain the reasons for their bad behaviour.",
    "**Neil:** And finally, the idiom this and that describes [[various|various-adjective]] [[unspecified|unspecified-adjective]] things. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not test yourself with the programme [[quiz|quiz-noun]] and [[worksheet|worksheet-noun]], [[available|available-adjective]] now on our website bbclearningenglish.com. Goodbye for now.",
    "**Beth:** Bye!"
